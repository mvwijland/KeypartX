0,"I had a Dinner with friends in there. Its more lunch restaurant than Dinner place. No sake or spirits.Waitress was a bit lost.Food set (spicy japanese) was OK And Ok value. Sushi was disappointment And a little bit expensive. Eatable, but not the place to go for a dinner"
1,"We had the cheapest room located on the second floor and had a view of the pool / beach. The room was very clean, functional and we have nothing to complain about. The breakfast buffet was comprehensive, again the dinner buffet didn't really contain what we wanted. The smaller pool is quieter (near which our room was located), the larger one again has more families with children. Conveniently located and close by there is a 24 hour shop, a minute walk to the beach and the hotel staff is very helpful. It is not advisable to use the hotel laundry, but take your clothes to the laundry across the road, where the cleaning price is 70THB / kilo (incl. Ironing)."
2,"We had the cheapest AC room booked and it was just working. Great view of the beach, comfortable bed and functional toilet. The room rate included a 2-hour kayak rental and a 2-hour snorkelling equipment rental. However, we were here during the off-season so we got to use the snorkeling gear until we left the Resort. The beach is absolutely gorgeous and quiet, and with a little snorkeling you can find some great corals. If you want to go kayaking, I recommend going to Paradise Beach (where you can also walk) where you will find a magnificent sandy beach. The resort is a 5-10 minute walk to the other side of the island where you will find all the expensive hotels and congested beaches. Our resort was so good and we had a great time in Koh Nga that we ended up taking 3 extra nights in addition to 4 nights. I can't help but recommend!"
3,"The location of Rassada Place is contemporary among the locals, meaning no shops etc are really close by but about a 30 - 60 min walk away. This is a great place to stay if you leave the next day, for example from Rassada Pier elsewhere. The room is very clean and has everything you need. Breakfast was a slice of bread so I wouldn’t trust it. The toilets are shared between some rooms, but for example we had our own toilet in connection with our room which was also used by someone from the second floor. When we stayed here there were no other guests at all, so we got free use of the restroom."
4,Nice cottage with everything you need (we had the cheapest with AC) in a good location. One minute walk to the beach with good restaurants and hangouts. Next to the hotel was a ski resort where you can rent a scooter for 250THB / day. For as you leave you drive south to find absolutely stunning beats! Near the hotel (about 7 min walk to the beach) is 7-11.
5,"Not a special place, lots of tourists and sees things but this time you have to pay for it. The beach was dirty and the water cloudy, lots of debris floating (in April). The monkeys meant to open the backpack and knock out the stuff from there but luckily the other tourists rushed them away."
6,"It was nice to walk through the rainforest, although it was a bit awkward in places but not in any way difficult for two people in normal condition. However, I recommend taking sneakers with you and not slippers. A nice, small waterfall was waiting for me at the destination, where at least in April it didn't come terribly. There was a bit of cooling and swimming in the water. You should head here in the morning so there is not much crowd!"
7,"Generally I like Subway. Quality is the same like in McDonalds and you know what you will receive.I must say, that there is thousand better place to eat in Bangkok, but I wanted to have my sub - and i got it.I prefer: Sesami-Tuna-SouthwestBeen there teen times and will be there again."
8,"Great facade and great hotel, maybe a little too big, but everything worked just fine on the last one, even though it was only one night in that place, yes I think it was worth a visit to try that place"
9,"Well, the night came to be tested on a holiday trip, not quite what beer I thought, ie Luxury, but everything worked great and there was a nice staff, That what I said wasn't exactly what I expected doesn't mean anything was wrong. I recommend"
10,"Located in Soi Lemke right next to Soi Buakhao, this little hidden gemstone is the tastiest I've ever eaten, if you like it I recommend it"
11,"Good and clean beach. During high tide, the sandy beach becomes quite small. Near the beach a few restaurants and shops."
12,"Here was a good beach for swimming and sunbathing. You should come here earlier in the morning to get some good places on the beach. Later in the day, the beach was often quite congested."
13,"Mainly long tail boats on the beach. I do not recommend the beach for swimming. Lots of debris on the beach, etc. A few kilometers away there are already better beaches."
14,"The restaurant is very close to our hotel, so you had to visit here several times during your stay. The food was good but not the cheapest place of all. A family of four went for money on both sides of a thousand baht per meal."
15,"We were on a trip with my family in January 2017. Rooms are spacious and clean. Pool area nice. Staff friendly. The minibar has pretty cheap prices, so the threshold for having a cold drink, for example, is not high. The Rawai area is a relatively quiet tourist area, making it an ok place for families overall. The nearby beach is not very strange, but a free ride from the hotel to a better beach every day."
16,"We had a Dinner menu (7courses) with My friend. At ten (10) I was ready to sleep. Its fine dining, you must pay - but it is Good... uuuh. I'm so full."
17,"Excellent drinks, music and great service! The employees also suggested taking a picture of me and my boyfriend at sukset and it turned out perfect. 10/10 would recommend!"
18,"Huge rooms, if you need space and are used to it, this is your choice. Nice on the side from the worst hustle and bustle, but still in the heart. The rooms have run out of space, but the space replaces the shine. Good breakfast. Nice staff."
19,A short boat ride from the stalemate. Cleaner water than in front of the city and clearly more comfortable. Quite a nice day trip destination.
20,Here you can take a few hours to wander around the market. built entirely on water. You can also eat and drink here.
21,"Such a place is not to be found anywhere else. Everything you can imagine is on offer, THOUSANDS. Just the usual rice field stuff, professional marsupials, back hood and bats. There is a basket change and all the other gifts from side to side. And with Asian kindness. This place takes even the most shy of the boy / girl in the back room to the sighs of the sin before the light cat recounts. And don't want to get out of there. I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND."
22,Products for young artisans at affordable prices and free concerts. Lots of dishes also available.
23,"Really friendly, helpful and caring staff. Room spacious, clean and clean. Bathrobes, pool towels and sandals were a plus. There is a daily maid service and free refreshments in the fridge. The pool area is a pleasant and quiet whole. Breakfast rich and varied. Extrana fresh fruit. The hotel has its own free shuttle to the evening market. Near the hotel is a large shopping center with changing events in the yard. The sea is close. The hotel is well suited for adult travelers."
24,"The Italian type of food was good. Nice staff and drinks were also in taste. Daily ""happy hour""."
25,"A good place to have a stopover in Bangkok as I was travelling from Bali to Stockholm I decided to spend one night in Bangkok. The room is really spacious, equipped with minimal, TV, Ac and a balcony. Even though it is located close to the airport the rooms are quiet and I really appreciated the transfer from the airport to the hostel and back to the airport next morning! The restaurant has good Thai food."
26,"Room a little worn. Some items to repair in the bathroom. The hotel has its own shuttle bus, which runs several times a day to major shopping malls and the metro station. The hotel has a good gym and the opportunity to participate in yoga, for example. On the roof deck, a smaller pool area with a Finnish sauna. Staff matter-of-fact and friendly."
27,Good Thai food at an affordable price. Extensive menu. Nice staff. Cozy environment.
28,"I had a dinner in there with my friends and it was disappointment.Three people: We had ""US tacos"" - dont remember the exact name and there was just three very tiny Tacos (for each) and Few nachos with it. As an extra we had Guacamole (95B), sour cream (45b) and two beer, 3 water, 1 cola and a strawberry drink (non alcoholic).TOTAL: ~ 1.900Baht.The portion was quite smallFood was mostly tasteless. Even Salsa was not spicy.I cannot say, that it was bad, but I have eaten dozen of better Mexican restaurants and over 50€ for this kind of meal was way too much."
29,I love Subway and I have eat in 50? Different subways around a world. The quality is always the same and If i want western food i rather go there than to McDonalds.Like everywhere - there you can customize your sandwitch and I like to eat Sesami-Tuna-Southwest combo with cheese and different vedgetables.Same everywhere - like this one
30,"Sometimes I have a feeling, that i'd like to eat some western comfort food and this is one option for it.Ribs, wings, burgers. Quality is the same everywhere. Taste is awerage, but you get what you expect. Prices are a Little bit high, but sometimes its good alternative to have a couple of good cocktails and a burger"
31,I'v been there a couple of times. Its alternative for other Hamburger chains and the meat is more softer & bigger. Burgers are big and they like to use a lot of bacon.Its OK - rather this than burger king
32,"I have been there few times. Prices are high, but Plan Pizzas are good.Thai speciality is Sea food pizza with thousand island sauva instead of tomatoe sauce. I dont know, should I describe it more pie than pizza, but I like it :)Easy way to get extremely full with good standardi quality plan pizza"
33,"We had a dinner there with friends and we ate-chicken Khorma-Butter chicken-prawns-Butter naan-papadami-Mixed raitha-plus beveragesTOTAL : 1.800BFood was good and tasty. I had nothing to complain. It was not the best Indian, where I have been, but it was delicious and I will visit there again."
34,"Yes, I like a place like this where everything has to do with the name and the name itself. The market is for food lovers. It is full of food stalls with a variety of seafood available such as fish, shrimp, crabs, scallops. The seafood has just been cooked i.e. Wau ......."
35,"The operation of the hotel was not affected. We called 2 days earlier that we would be coming in the morning and asked if there was a possibility to get a room right from the morning. The phone reassured me that the thing was ok. When we arrived there was no room to go. We inquired that why they said on the phone that thing ok if there is no room. The Respan woman said the check in is at 2pm Yes we knew why we called and asked if it was ok if we came in the morning. We got the room a little after 12 because the men who came to us wanted 2 beds and then the respan woman shouted at them where it reads you want 2 beds. I don't think the service is very friendly. The hotel room was really small and I find it strange that the toilet door is glass, well not quite clear glass after all but still visible through. Everything worked in the room but a really small room. I hope Aunt’s aunt just had a bad day but didn’t leave me feeling like going back again."
36,Skytrain is a really convenient way to get around Bangkok. Nice and fast movement. Taxis and tuk logs often want to fund extra so I think Skytrain is the best option for getting around. Trains run frequently so you don’t have to wait long at the station either. The stations and trains are clean although there are really a lot of people on the trains in between.
37,"I have been to this hotel before but the last experience was bad. The first room did not have air conditioning or a refrigerator, and at first there was no television. The television was replaced immediately, but nothing else was interfered with. We went spinning nearby for about 3 hours and before we left we talked about the problems again. The staff kept the air conditioning on all the time but the room did not cool down at all. The water in the refrigerator also remained hot. After complaining, we got a change of room with air conditioning, but still the fridge kept the drinks warm. When changing the room, the hotel staff complained when we had used the towels. The towels were really old and worn. The next morning the ride to the airport left more than 15 minutes late. The ride was already leaving once and then it was decided to wait for the family that woke up late. The good thing is that the hotel is not far from the field, although in the mornings there is always a little traffic, you can get to the field relatively quickly, but now there was no time left for others. Anyway, I don’t think the staff wanted to take it seriously from our chosen very hot room."
38,"I have been there several times with my friends. They have a girl band (all players are girls) playing every night cover music.Good drinks and relaxing atmophere. I have been there many times, in many different year and I will go there again."
39,"We stayed here in january 2015 as well, and we loved the resort then. In two years it has turned very touristy, but luckily filled with families, (since I have a kid too), not party people. The woman, named Oi, in the reception is more than friendly, I really liked her a lot. You can see that she isn't trying, she just is what she is: loves talking with people, and helps everyone with a good heart. My 4-year old daughter liked her a lot too. I got stung by a jelly fish and Oi called a doctor without even asking me if i want to because she was worried, and they arrived in 5 minutes and took me to the hospital, because my foot was really swollen and the doctor said it might be the box one. Thanks to Oi who helped me. I survived. The rooms were new in 2015, so they were clean and cozy. Now, two years later, they are a bit dirty, there's ants in the bed and bugs everywhere, even if u keep the door closed all the time. You'll get used to it, but the ants where removed from our bed since I told Oi about it, and luckily we got completely rid of them for good. Both times we stayed here, we had a room upstairs with a balcony. First they put us in a room downstairs because they thought it's ""better for kids"" but it isn't, and the room/terrace is more lame there. Downstairs it's noisy since everyone is walking and chatting right in front of your door and there's no cozy hammock on the terrace. We moved upstairs directly after we'd seen the room downstairs, and it was more than okay for Oi. Upstairs it was more quite and the room was bigger, and you could see the ocean from the balcony (from the terrace you saw walls and tourists). I definitely recommend the second floor bungalows for everyone who appreciates privacy, even if the rooms downstairs looks good from outside and seem like a good idea first. (The wedding suites have small private pools outside but I don't think they're worth a visit.)Theres a big pool on the yard a few meters from the beach, for adults, and a smaller for children right next to it. The breakfast is included in the room cost and it's like a continental breakfast or more like a pick 'n' mix with what u like. If u want bacon it costs a little extra. A man waiter who's working at banana beach restaurant, is a bit too exited about kids. He doesn't mean anything bad but he just kisses all kids and make fun with them when they're eating breakfast, all the time and too much, so even my little daughter didn't laugh at him anymore. She thought it was weird when a stranger asked her to kiss him all the time, and didn't stop asking even if she said she doesn't want to. Even thoug the rooms are average in these days, the location of this resort is great. It's in the other end of the klong dao beach which is more private and quite than for eg in the middle, and located it's right on the beach. At night, there's an annoying reggaebar next to the resort where some really bad singers with a bad english accent sing in an echoing mic, and it's so loud it's almost like someone really smashed is singing karaoke in your bedroom, so I recommend ear plugs.Over all, we've always had a great stay here and from our 6-week thai vacay, a planned 3-days stay in banana beach turn out to be 2 weeks since we didn't wanna leave. Of your in lanta with kids, choose this one, it's the best. "
40,"We went to eat here a couple of times on our vacation and once we took a take away. Tasty Thai food at a good price. The first time we ended up here was because it was located opposite our hotel and burdened with a long flight and time difference, we couldn’t go any further to look for food on the first night - it was a good idea! Nothing to blame :)"
41,Madam Tussauds Wax Office is located in Siam Discovery Mall. Here you can take good pictures and close to celebrities. There were a lot of wax dolls. Siam BTS station was just a short walk away.
42,"The hotel was clean, quiet and affordable. The breakfast was varied and tasty. The room was on 7 floors with a window overlooking the street. the store was 50 meters away.The room was on a four star level indeed."
43,"The golden Buddha statue weighing 5,500 kilos in the holy temple is five meters high and is worth seeing. The temple also has information on the history of the statue. Shoes are not allowed to go to the temple."
44,"Adjacent to the Siam-Skytrain station, an American rib and pasta restaurant in the terminal 21 shopping center with very good food but slightly more expensive compared to the rest of Bangkok's price. Good service and clean place. Great street views from the restaurant."
45,An affordable and safe way to see the center of Bangkok.
46,A peaceful little island where the sun shines at full power directly above this is the dream place of a sun worshiper.Speed boat went directly to the shore of the island.
47,"We went to see what kind of pizza is available here when it was praised at the trip advisor, so it was worth visiting a good, clean and affordable café."
48,"We got to spend rainy days here in March. The zoo was almost empty due to the weather, although the small drops did not interfere with walking and the animals were well on display. The area is surprisingly clean. There are adequate toilets and the funniest thing is that there is a 7/11 inside the zoo."
49,"Booked this hotel for sauna and gym. The bathroom sauna room was not air-conditioned and the lockers were old and rusty IE. the locks didn't work at all. So you had to leave your stuff basically without any protection as the doors are not locked and anyone can basically walk in. Sauna itself was pretty much OK, there was enough heat (if you heat it up first) but the scoop for throwing water on the sauna stove was really poor and didn't work well (totally nonfunctional, get a new proper one!). One time the guard switch the sauna off after I just had turned it on and started training in the gym. Gym is pretty large and clean and has free hand weights up to 15 kg if remember correct (might be up to 20kg too). There's not mattresses available in the gym so you can't even do yoga. Other than that it's not that diverse set of machines (could use couple more). Better room class rooms are way better than the basic rooms especially without windows. Basic rooms have pretty horrible shower closets where you really have to fear the floor to break... There is tuktuk service available but never really got to use it as the driver was ""always on the lunch break"" when I did exit the building (usually about 12-1 pm). WTF there was 3 dudes waiting and sitting doing nothing and nobody of them could drive the tuktuk? Elevators have lots of tacky looking signs prohibiting you from doing certain things. Rooms have huge cockroachs infestations so if that is a problem for you better to stay away. Also it's pity that they have removed the washing machines from deluxe rooms (suites should still have em). Washing machines used to be the reason for booking this hotel for so many times. "
50,I have coming to this restaurant for over 15 years. Food is always good and price are cheap. Local deserts sticky rice with mango is so good.
51,The view is amazing. One of best what Phuket offer. The old Rastafar spirit is gone now the plays is so expensive. Recommend to drinks only and look amazing view.
52,"I have been there few times during last 5? Years. The food is good, but expensive to comparing other places nearby. I complain the ""Rush"" they have in there. You can go, eat and go. The way how they serve is extremely fast - in a same second (or before) you end up your starter, maincourse is on a table.I gonna visit there again, but it is not a place for a lazy evening to take few with friends or romantiikan dinner."
53,I have been there few times. Once for a dinner and few times for a drinks.Firstly: the view is amazing.Food is good and expensive - like you can expect in this place.This is one of rare restaurants in Pattaya - where you can have real Mojitos and cocktails. Definitely worth to visit.
54,"Robinsons was over 10 years ago the department store in Phuket, but now it is old sad place, full of nothing and the price are still very high. I do not recommend."
55,You will fine small shops in small streets. Lot of the old charm and history of colonialists time. My favourite part of phuket. Traffic is very challenging but I always love that aspect also because it is real.
56,Wat Chalong is a old and big temple in Chalong. Place is big and beautiful. Remember the local culture and respect.
57,Biggest in phuket and in few years they will grow even bigger. Now is very hard to fine a car parking place. Lot of shop and restaurants. Big minus no free wifi for tourist.
58,"Been in Fuji restaurant many time. Sushi is good but amazing, rice is tasty and not mushy, fish taste fresh. Service is typically thai style, dishes come when it was ready one by one and in between you have to wait long time."
59,"I remember the first time I was in the restaurant it was before the millennium, and the restaurant is still up running. Food is still solid and the price is low. To get there is always difficult if you don't have motorbike or car because it is in Phuket town."
60,"Great location next to Hualampho,  7/11 and many places to eat. Rooms are clean, with ac, clean bathroom and minibar. Great place to stay over night.No elevator, so it`s possible you need to carry your bags 5 floors up."
61,Service is friendly and the restaurant is clean. Price of food is a bit higher than normal but they use at least two time more meat or seafood portion. Taste of the food is ok.
62,"Yes, there are hundreds of different species that live in the ocean. This huge sea world is built on the ground floor of the Siam Paragon Mall. I recommend this to all sea animal lovers."
63,First I was little skeptic about the hotel because it name is Saturdays Residence. It is really as good as it in the pictures. Really nice Scandinavian style. Service is good. Rooms are big and have everything what you need we you travel with a family.
64,Just stop by Mr Gung BBQ. It was really nice surprise. The restaurant was really clean. Not a huge amount of different food to choose but still enough. Hole family really like. I recommend the restaurant.
65,Big restaurant but don't let that scares you away. Service is good and food is ok. Not bad. Lot of different seafood to try.
66,"Because of all the big and five star hotel around it, that makes it lit too pricey. All the food and services are higher than anywhere else."
67,Restaurant is nicely decorated restaurant. Staff are friendly and you can get that old Thailand friendly what now is missing in lots of places. Food is good but like all in Mai Khao area little bit expensive. In our party one kid want nuggets and fries it cost 150 b for three nuggets and few fries.
68,"Burgers was good as always in Burger King, but service was so bad. Famous Thai smile and kindness was far gone in this generation. You have to take your order to go. There's no table or sits were to eat."
69,Chinatowns are always good place to visit and this one don't make any exceptions. All the shops and restaurant are very exciting. Must visit.
70,"If you want to spend hole day shopping, this place is for you. They don't have luxury brands but everything else. 7 floors"
71,"Our first day in Samui started by axident in Lamai Beach. Our Tuk Tuk dropped us down in main road. The we headed straight to beach anfound out this lovely Bamboo restaurant. The beach it self is long to walk and enjoy. Cold Singhas available in 100 THB for large one. Oyr lunch with steamed squid and mine Tom Yam Pheed were very good.Easy pick for tomorow, why change it if it is working."
72,"Food was ok, not anything special, salmon sashimi was bad fish was frozen and melted fast so all the taste was gone and it also had been coloured because it was too red not like natural color."
73,We booked junior suite for two adult and two kid. When we arrived to a room. We have only on big bed for 4 people. They charge us 500 Bt for a extra bed for every night. Staff were nice. Hotel located 1 km from Mbk shopping Center.
74,Full of pack packers and so crowded. Hostels around the area are terrible and not worth any bath. Sellers pulling your arm and try to sell to you.
75,"Leeloo Paradice is a wonderfully quiet, clean, small bungalow hotel about 500 meters from the magnificent 9 km long Na Dan beach, where you can walk and stay all alone! The French couple who own the hotel do not speak much English, but the communication was successful thanks to the mobile applications and the language skills of a few local employees. Our cottage was clean, atmospheric and had a good bed, air conditioning and a fan. It also had a minibar and a private toilet + bathroom. In front of the cottage was a small sheltered terrace with chairs and tables. The only downside was the really iron-containing tap water that both smelled of rust and stained our fist laundry. The hotel staff was super-friendly! They helped us arrange things related to, for example, a rental moped and a trip home. The stay also included breakfast: coffee, juice, toast and plenty of fruit. We also ate every night at that hotel’s own restaurant, where Thai food was heavenly! A convenience store run by a local couple can be found 700 meters away near the Aava Hotel. The place is not suitable for sun worshipers if you want to stay in the hotel pool. It is a very shady area with no actual sun loungers. Of course, you can always walk to the beach to lie down on a towel. There are no sun loungers there either. WE ARE HIGHLY RECOMMEND LEELOO PARADISE HOTEL AND ALSO IT`S WONDERFUL RESTAURANT WITH EXCELLENT THAI FOOD!"
76,"I think that restaurant owner was in Italy now. We ordered Salami Pizza for our team of two. Pizzas was quite ok in quality, but something was missing in taste wise. Im sure when high season starts and chef himself is back in kitchen, taste and overall quality will go up. Bottom of pizzas shoved good pizza oven in kitchen."
77,"We had dinner with my wife yesterday just before tremendous thunder storm. Thanks not to choose desert we made it back to our resort with dry feet. Starter was selection of chinese raviolis or dumplings. Pasta flambee schrimps was real treat, exelent dish. My wife had chicken sate with peanut dip. This was also very tasty. I even tried my 80's favorite disco drink pastis with coke. Lots of memories with this drink. ""Stayin' Alive"" Owner and staff very friendly and our opinion for this restaurant is very good in it class. One small street with many restaurants and Beach Way is definetly clear winner. My honest opininon."
78,"If you want to escape to the beautiful island of Phuket for at least one night, I recommend Koh Racha. The golden time at Raya Father Resort seemed to be behind us and everything was a bit broken or in need of repair. We had an air-conditioned room that was enough for one night, but for a longer period of time I would not have agreed to stay. The bed was hard and the mattress dirty. The door was not tight, but it was still locked. The bathroom was small and needed repairs. The room had its own water heater. I recommend bringing a flashlight if you like to move in the dark. We ate two lunches and one dinner at the resort. The man became ill back in Phuket after getting a severe stomach upset. Whether due to food or something. We bought accommodation as part of a boat trip. The island itself is magnificent and is best enjoyed by staying there, as only a small number of tourists remain on the island after the day tourists leave. Walking makes it easy to move between different resorts and beaches."
79,"Pros: + Several pool areas (3 pcs) + Room wifi exceeded the pool, the hotel's general wifi function + Excellent breakfast buffet (go for brunch) + Friendly staff + Close to restaurants + Beds in the room + Some activity on offer every day Cons: - The door is not tight, but the upstairs room did not bother (no extra bugs or mosquitoes were visible) - A little far from the beach (less than 10 min walk) but the transport can be done without walking The music of the nearby restaurant was inside but stopped playing maybe at 10 pm I could go back immediately :) On the advice I could recommend other beaches on the island! For example, the Kata Noi next door was more comfortable in our opinion than the one next to the hotel. They are well accessible on foot from the hotel. Although the route goes through a steep hill, but after a little sports it is nice to take a dip in the sea;)"
80,"Stayed 11 nights in Khwan Resort in Villa with pool. Villa was clean and well equiped with minibar and so important safebox. Pool was much more than plunge pool and after tuktuk drive from Lamai Beach to resort it was great refressing treat to go in your own pool. Resort staff was really nice and courteous. Always smiling and saying hello or do you need something. You might ask why I mentioned Lamai Beach ? Mae Nam beach is also ok, but very shallow and there is hardly nobady else than you. If you like private beach then dont go anywhere else. Our team wants services food and drinks on the spot and also sunbed and umberella. Lamai Beach can provide all these things. Lamai is also more quiet that Chaveng. Tuktuk from Mae Nam to Lamai Beach / Mc Donald is 400 THB. It is better to say Mc Donalds because every driver knows it so you are always in right place.Breakfast was good, but ordering with many different possibilities is a little bit confusing. See the many and you know what I mean.Passa restaurant serve fine dining food in the evenings and Chef With his team can create good dishes and quality wines are available too.Thanks for relaxing time in Khwan Beach Resort "
81,Nice going and live bands play in the evenings. On the terrace you can watch sports from the screen. Popular with locals.
82,Nicely built modernist and the rooms clean and the bathroom also neat. There is no storage space for clothes but they must be stored in bags. A fridge can be found in the room and tea and water are provided free of charge in the room. Breakfast should be chosen from a few options of what you want to eat the next morning. Nice place to stay for a night or a couple. Mainly young Asian tourists. Small construction site at the hostel. Make the terrace and the sound of the rattlesnake carried but not disturbed badly.
83,The service was slow and poor anyway. Customers are just tourists. The waitress got to ask herself several times and didn't smile once. The food was too unflavoured. Poor value for money. I do not recommend. Better and spicier food at local restaurants and at a lower price. Good location.
84,I recommend touring the six temples and buying a ticket 200b so you don’t have to pay an entrance fee for each one separately. We paid 300 b per 1.5 hours for the support.
85,This temple is also worth a visit to see and enjoy the historic structures. We toured the temples in all the temples in the area and recommend it because then you will see more. Calm in summer.
86,Located in Hilton hotel 17th floor. In the Hua Hin downtown. Awesome view over the bay of Siam. We went there 1800 and left 2000 so nice to see the view in daylight and when the darkness came and lights were on all over the city. Service was good. Mamoy (the waitress) was very sophistigated and warm. Prices were not that high that we assumed. Atmosphere was all in all very nice. There is an option also to eat outside in the balcony. On the other side of the building is also a very nice looking drink bar what was crowded as the place is with a so nice view. Quality in one word.
87,Girls' bars and more. Grocery stores and restaurants. An evening street that is worth a look. A lot of tourists. It was a much cooler place than I thought it would be.
88,You will never be disappointed with these doses. You always get the same good taste and drinking water with ice cream on the table. The employees could have been kinder and better served.
89,"We have 4 nights booking in this hotel. Exelent location Chitlom Skytrain is very close. Easy travel to Siam Paragon, MBK, Chatuchac weekend market. Hotel staff is very helpful and courteous. We asked very quiet room because we are sensitive sleepers. Top floor 22 sounds right, but acoustic is really bad and you can hear next door neighbourgs toilet visits, shover and speaking very clearly. Gladly they did not have grande partys so far. We have earplugs to help our sleeping. 21th Club Lounge is rather nice but hotel policy is we axcept children also in Club Lounge. Kids are kids and you sure know what might happens. I think that some acoustic panels in Club Lounge could help ""too noisy"" feeling. Floor and ceilings are hard material and also roof is not equiped with any acoustic panels. Due these issues small noise will be big noise when soundwaves bounhing from hard to hard materials. Club Lounge dresscode is not mandatory because we have seen fellow visitors with flip flops, and shorts. We at least I try to follow rules. Breakfast and evening happy hour servings are good and service personal are really nice. We have 2 more night to go before our trip back home and we will manege it for sure.Sorry for too technical review, but these are my thoughts. "
90,"Very high quality hotel and suitable for single people, couples and families with children. The pool area is really big and varied. For children a water park and slides. Guided activities for the whole family. Breakfast really varied. The best breakfast I have enjoyed while traveling to Thailand. The room was nicely decorated and we got a better room on the 17th floor and we had booked a standard deluxe room. Fresh fruit and bottles of water are brought to the room daily. Great sea views and a large balcony with two sun loungers. The hotel has its own shuttle service for 50b for several hours a day to the Central Festival Shopping Center. The staff serves the customers well and the room service is really fast. I highly recommend the Centara Grand Mirage."
91,"20 minutes waiting for table, but no worries. You can see masters of dumplings through glass window in action. We like dumplings and have eated in Singapore earlier few years back. Same standars and same waiting time not bad at all. I bit pricy but worth the splurge."
92,Nice place in the evening even harder. It's worth a try and take a look. I warmly recommend to all visitors here
93,Beautifully laid out dishes and a cozy little restaurant. The food was tasty. The price was not the cheapest end. Worth a test. Friendly staff and free wi-fi.
94,"Large hotel area with a good location and private beach. Activities can be found every day. I used Spa treatments twice and wonderful treatments all at once. Restaurant ok and breakfast just fine. The pools are good and the beach is nice. I recommend it to both couples and families. Some wear and tear in the hotel, but I still think it is clean and good value for money."
95,Nice restaurant. Lovely laid out dishes on a plate. Good food and friendly service. Good value for money.
96,"Just fine food, but it's cheaper to get similar, if not better, food from outside the hotel. Breakfast quite varied and a typical Thai hotel breakfast."
97,"Good seafood restaurant. We ate crabs, octopus and fish. The service was good and the price level ok. We warmly recommend this seafood restaurant."
98,"A decent hotel just off the beaten track. The rooms are neat, even they need updating. The hotel had just 1-2 other customers besides us, so the atmosphere was sleepy and calm.The bungalows' terrace has a magnificent view of the sea. Service was friendly. The staff helped us withrenting scooters, ticket purchase, laundry service and more."
99,This means of transportation can be warmly recommended for getting around Bangkok. Quick changes and wonderful air conditioning. I recommend buying a day ticket if there are more passes. Easy and costs 140tb for a 1-day ticket that always ends at midnight.
100,You should visit right in the morning and experience the hustle and bustle of the market. Also get good food and drink. Skytrain provides easy access. Small stalls by the hundreds and prices good.
101,Lots of restaurants and gold shops. We went out to dinner with friends in the evening. We ate shark soup and other special dishes. I recommend visiting this neighborhood both day and evening.
102,"Lovely location by the river. We stayed at the hotel for four nights. We got a better room on the 25th floor and it was actually an apartment. Living room and small kitchen and separate bedroom. Large balcony with chairs and table. Modernly decorated. The bathroom had a separate bath and shower. The service was great in every way. Breakfast fantastic and really beautifully put all up. Swimming pool good and great river views. There should have been a few more sun loungers. The hotel’s own ferry takes you frequently to the adjacent station in 5 minutes, from where you can continue your journey by Sky train or local river boat. I warmly recommend Chatrium Hotel."
103,We went to an evening drink to admire the spectacular scenery. I recommend experiencing this restaurant. Dress well. Prices high but worth it.
104,"You can go on the river with your self-rented boat, tourist boats, dinner boat, youth party boat or local orange flag boat for the most affordable and great experience. The ""local bus"" costs 14tb and from there you can get a good view of the city from the river. Stops relatively frequently and if you want to go to the stops from end to end it takes about 2 hours. Of course it depends on how many passengers there are, but usually the boats are full."
105,"Slightly out of the way, but on the other hand just in a good way from all the hustle and bustle. Family room large, relatively cozy. Not a luxury, but suitable for this price range. Admittedly, the price has risen every year in my opinion. There are no big shops very close, but they can be reached by car. There is also a chain restaurant nearby in addition to good local restaurants. The food at the hotel, except for breakfast, was expensive and sometimes a little poor, so we preferred the locals. The market is also a great place to buy fruit, etc. A doctor (a good one) can be found at Sunwing, a short taxi / walk away. Medicines are included. The beach is good and quiet! The pool areas are nice and all kinds of activities are available on request. I would definitely recommend the hotel."
106,Good duck and other Asian fast food. Mangosmoothie was also good. The food was ordered from the table itself on the tablet and quickly came to the table. Very nice place. I recommend to experience.
107,"This is certainly the most expensive hotel we have stayed in on many trips to Thailand. Of course, you also get value for money. The hotel is really great and the location is great. Within walking distance of the shopping boutiques, department stores and many restaurants of Siam Square. You can access MBK's shopping hell directly from the lobby. If you appreciate the hotel’s location and good pool area, this is a great choice. The pool is sunny all day and there are plenty of sun loungers. The pool is large and the bar service plays. Breakfast is great, better you can hardly get anywhere. The only downside to the hotel is the very high prices for drinks. You can pay the same price for beer and refreshments as in home Finland. Thai-style robbery downright! The price of the room was also hard. You can probably get the same level of luxury hotels in the Sukhumvit area at a lower price. And please note that breakfast is not included in the cheapest rates."
108,"We were in Khao Lak for the second time and in this cozy hotel for the first time. We stayed for six nights. The hotel’s location is excellent near the center of Khao Lak and close to the beach. You can walk to the heart of the city in 10 minutes, of course this whole trip includes a lot of restaurants and little shops. In the center then dozens of choices. The beach is only about 150 meters! And the beach at the hotel is really gorgeous. The room was on the terrace facing the pool, opposite the bar. We were afraid the sounds of the bar would carry into the room, but the place was really quiet. The sound insulation is really good. The room was spacious and clean. The hotel area is beautiful and comfortable. The pool area is spacious and has plenty of sun loungers both right on the edge of the pool and in the lawn area. The bar service works well for both the pool and the room terrace, and drinks are reasonably priced. Happy our afternoons, drinks at half price. Breakfast was good and varied. Except for lunch, we did not otherwise dine at the hotel. We were on a self-guided trip and the hotel is reasonably priced compared to expensive beach resorts. However, the framework and service are excellent and value for money. And to the beach you can sip from the pool in a few minutes. We will be happy to come again. The hotel does not have chairs on the beach, but about 200 meters down the street from the main entrance is a beach restaurant with free beach chairs for guests. It is polite that at some point you even order a refreshment. And they are cheap. The food is also good and inexpensive. It is visited by a lot of people enjoying lunch."
109,I would definitely go again if the journey is in that direction. The wax stories were genuine and there were plenty of them
110,"Overall a very comfortable and high quality hotel. Slight wear in the room. Good service. The connection to the nearby bts station by boat is working properly. It didn’t bother at all that the hotel wasn’t next to the bts station. Good view of the 34th floor suite from both the river and the city. Two balconies with views. We always had elevators fast. Breakfast at once fantastic, it's worth having. The second bedroom had a slightly strange pee-like odor that remained almost imperceptible due to air conditioning."
111,Very nice snack with beer. Fried shrimps with garlic sauce. Very nice service too :) will come back.
112,"Coincidentally, we got lost in a place that turned out to be an excellent ""Japanese People's Cup."" The place is popular with locals (Japanese tourists) and does not favor. We sat on top of the beer baskets, side by side with the others but the atmosphere was real! Going and food really good! We ate the basic set: nigiri, shashimi, kyosa, miso soup and of course Asahi and sake for the ride boy. Was really good and value for money in place! I recommend!"
113,"Whiskeys with a little food enjoyed while quietly making music, what not? The discreet bar of the magnificent hotel complex, where you can still feel the wings of history, has a sophisticated atmosphere and very friendly service. However, the feeling is suitably relaxed, there is no way to go in an evening dress; )"
114,"We booked a villa with our own pool, which was very clean and the right size. A small lovely addition was another shower and bath on the outdoor terrace. either in the restaurant of the villa village or in the Lounge of the Centara Hotel itself with its little food. We ate at all the restaurants in the hotel and the food was really tasty everywhere. Special mention of a private dinner on the beach, absolutely awesome! The staff were super friendly and everything went as it should in that level of place. an absolute favorite in Hua Hin."
115,"We stayed one week in executive room with lounge benefits and breakfast. Room was A bit dated but service At restaurants, pool, reception, concierge... was best ever.Lounge meant there 2 hours free drinks and canapes daily At one of the bars.Service there was also phenomenal. They remembered  your room number, yesterdays drinks etc... Also At breakfast we got hot milkfoam cups with our names on top and nobody asked our room or names when we we’re guided to table.Also pool/fitness-area was nice and never too crowded.Area was nice for our taste and taxis we’re always easy to get when going to shopping or sights "
116,Siam is a huge place with many shopping complexes. Paragon is most upscale w Vuitton etc..Aircon is pleasant in whole place and What is nice for us europeans we get VAT back from shoppings over 2000bht. Paragon departmentstore had -20% off almost everything so we made many good deals from there.Vuitton store is not as big as in Gaysorn -mall so we recommend that especially if you are looking for mens collection
117,I like to visit here because the menu is varied and the service is prompt. Burgers are delicious but so are soups and other magic dishes. The hotel is always on the side of pattayacity but this has to be visited a few times.
